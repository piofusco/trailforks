# Trailforks takehome

## Instructions

The goal is to refactor a very simple Cordova app to a native iOS swift app. You may use UIKit or SwiftUI - whichever 
you're most comfortable with. The test app is a single screen that makes an efficient API call to get some recent trail 
reports and outputs them to the screen. The task is to look at the AngularJS and html code within the app to aid in the 
refactoring. The app has an XCode project bundled with it that can be built with XCode to view the Cordova app, this is 
located in the "platforms/ios/" folder. Once you finish it, please zip up your code and email it to us.
